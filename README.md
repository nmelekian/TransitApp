# Overview

  TransitApp, otherwise known by the new name of BetterRide, is an app designed for public transportation users in the Detroit area to help provide feedback about their ride in a more effective way. 
  
## Background

  The city of Detroit has a large problem with transportation. Unreliable bus rides, unsafe stops, late arrivals, or long delays even if they manage to show up at all. Being in the Motor City. 1/3 of Detroiter's do not have access to a car, so they must rely on a public transportation system that is wholly unreliable. BetterRide is meant to provide the riders a way to feel that their feedback is effective and might actually been seen to improve the ride.
  
### Main Function
  
  The main function of BetterRide is to provde a feedback form for transit riders to use. With a seamless flow between pages, the app provides a smooth, simple and accessible way to provide feedback. By choosing the category of complaint, the date of the event, and providing images in your report will help to give the necessary information to the Department of Transportation and other offices related to the rider experience. Our goal is to help the city of Detroit improve public transportation.
